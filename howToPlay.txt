Game Setup:
Enter both player names and amount of time for each turn. 60 seconds is
recommended for the turn time limit. However, if youâ€™re looking for a
challenge, 20 seconds will lead to some fast-paced action

How To Win:

the 30th turn or capture 60% of the total board area.

How To Move Your Pieces:
When its your turn select one of you piece on the board. On the left
you will see a list of potential moves. Select one of these to see
the movement path of that piece. Once you have chosen a move click
the "Move Piece" button in the bottom right.

How to Capture Territory:
To capture territory move your pieces around the board. Each piece
moves in their own unique way. Explore the different movements options
of each piece to see which method works for you.

Attacking the Enemy Pieces:
Each piece has a way of hindering the opposing pieces. For example,
when the Hammerhead Shark moves, it will slam its hammer into the
ground. Any opposing piece that is caught in the line of fire will
find its way back to its starting line. Like with movement, each piece
attacks differently. Experiment with the different pieces to find the
best mode of offense.
